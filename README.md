# AI Coding Standards

A comprehensive collection of standards, guidelines, and best practices for AI-assisted software development. These standards help teams produce consistent, high-quality code outputs when working with AI coding assistants.

## Overview

This repository provides documentation and guidance for:
- **AI Development Principles** - Core standards for code quality, testing, and security
- **Linter Configuration** - Guidelines for setting up and sharing linter configurations
- **AI Limitations** - Understanding constraints when working with AI assistants
- **Sharing Guidelines** - Best practices for sharing configurations across teams

## Documentation

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [AI Development Principles](docs/ai-development-principles.md) | Core principles for maintaining code quality in AI-assisted development |
| [Linter Configuration](docs/linter-configuration.md) | Language-specific linter recommendations and configuration examples |
| [AI Limitations](docs/ai-limitations.md) | Understanding and working within AI constraints |
| [Sharing Guidelines](docs/sharing-guidelines.md) | Strategies for sharing standards across teams |

## Quick Start

1. Review the [AI Development Principles](docs/ai-development-principles.md) to understand core standards
2. Set up linters using the [Linter Configuration](docs/linter-configuration.md) guide
3. Understand [AI Limitations](docs/ai-limitations.md) for effective AI collaboration
4. Follow [Sharing Guidelines](docs/sharing-guidelines.md) to adopt standards across your team

## Key Principles

- **Review all AI-generated code** - Treat AI output as you would any code submission
- **Use linters consistently** - Enforce code quality through automated tools
- **Make incremental changes** - Test and verify each change before proceeding
- **Share configurations** - Use version control and packages for team consistency
- **Document decisions** - Maintain clear documentation for standards and exceptions
